It is the year 40, 000 and the universe knows only war. Gone are the benign days of sunlit walks along a beach. Man knows true evil now.

If that sounds interesting to you then welcome! Welcome to the world of Warhammer 40k. A dystopian future of Mankinds fight amongst the stars. Man is not the savior of the universe in this story. Some are that true evil, looking to you Horus.

Granted the story of Horus is a sad one. A man who found truth and a lie and became corrupted by both. In his anger he lashed out killing his father The Emperor of Mankind, whose body was then suspended in death amongst a tomb that requires a thousand human sacrifices a day to keep alive.

This stuff writes itself. It is also ripped right out of one of the oldest stories told. A good fiction.

I have been engrossed in this world for a few years now. Warhammer 40k is Games Workshop’s most ambitious entity. Spanning a story that continues to be told, working rules systems and new models alongside massive plot developments. 40k is grand in scale, nothing is small and I have decided to join the fray.

I did not start here though. In the beginning it was swords and sorcery that introduced mine and my parents wallet to Games Workshop. Their other popular entity Warhammer Fantasy Battles was a retelling of Europe’s Medieval era with a very heavy fantasy lens.
Knights charging across a field with banners raised high. This was food for my young soul. Still is.

I will not go into how Games Workshop murdered the franchise here. It still exists in some manner in Age of Sigmar. If you play AoS I will not judge you. No, I will welcome you to the fold. I will be sad though and a little angry, not at you. Instead my anger is directed towards the guiding principle of Games Workshop, greed. Again I will not jump into that in this post, as I am just introducing you to the world.

Please know that my intention is not to dissuade you to join this fantastic hobby. It has its benefits and it has its drawbacks. If you are looking for a community that is accepting to the new and uninitiated than look no further. Gatekeepers are summarily gatekeep’d from this franchise. Someone Gatekeeps you? Point me in their direction. I got you.
The community is fantastic in this franchise. Attend a local tournament and see for yourself. If you are in Toronto I highly recommend GTA 40k.
If you are looking for a complicated board game that stretches the mind and imagination, relies on both luck and skill, memory and daring. This hobby is for you. The rule system evolves over time as new units, new armies and new play-systems are added. There are casual, story and competitive modes in which you can roll six sided dice. 
If you are looking for a hobby that allows you to put together a kick ass looking army that will make some of your friends and family shake their head at, while others will nod slowly with pursed lips and wide eyes. This is the hobby for you.

I invite you to join me in my path. You can see me here at Linscott.ca or take a look at what my brother and I have cooked up over at Northammergames.gg.
